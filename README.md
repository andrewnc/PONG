# PONG

A pet project to work with Artificial Intelligence bots. 

This is a working version of pong using c++. There are three different bots you can play against, with their numbers associated with their difficulties. 

The 'best' (most intelligent) bot is bot #2. 

This project may require some c++ configuration on each machine to run, but when you get it to work, it's pretty cool!
